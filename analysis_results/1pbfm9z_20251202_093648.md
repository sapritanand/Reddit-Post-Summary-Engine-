### Key Insights

- {'insight': 'Reddit can be a source of profound, life-altering advice.', 'evidence': "At least three top comments detailed how a single Reddit comment fundamentally changed their outlook or habits. Specific examples include the user who decided to become a 'liker of things,' the user who realized they were an alcoholic from the phrase 'One is too many, because twelve isn't enough,' and the many who found solace in the 'waves' analogy for grief.", 'importance': "This shows the platform's capacity for genuine, positive impact on mental health and personal development, far beyond simple entertainment."}
- {'insight': "A shared 'Reddit Lore' creates a strong sense of community identity.", 'evidence': "Four of the top comments reference famous, platform-specific stories or phrases.
