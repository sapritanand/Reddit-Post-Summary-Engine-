Find a new doctor, possibly one off the Bible post. 

When i first got diagnosed with ureaplasma it took me multiple courses of antibiotics and retesting nearly 6-7 times until I finally got a negative result. It took me 2.5 years to finally test negative and what cured me was 2 weeks of doxycycline and azithro. 

Bible post helped me immensely...

Thank you for sharing. 

I am allergic to doxy although at this point I would risk taking it if it’s going to get rid of it. 

I have taken azithro, erithro, and metro....
