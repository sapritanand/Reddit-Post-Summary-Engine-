I dont think it is right because it is their job and they get paid by it. He was young and busy and I took a proposal I wanted not the project they wanted to be done. He took me because his boss wanted hime to do so. And choosing my phd supervisor, the plan a supervisor had no vacancy of student and the plan b prospective phd supervisor is in similar situation and I might go with the supervisor. The supervisor fit with my interest but it was terrible experience and I dont want to repeat it. Do you think I should avoid this new potential supervisor? ",

This past experience, where the supervisor took the user due to a superior's directive rather than genuine interest in the user's chosen project, has created apprehension. Now, facing a similar situation with a prospective PhD supervisor who fits their interest but evokes memories of the past negative dynamic, the user is seeking guidance on whether to avoid this new potential supervisor to prevent a repeat of the previous dissatisfaction."
